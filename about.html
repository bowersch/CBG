                        Okay, not the biggest fan of photographs when the subject includes myself, so you get a self-portrait I did a long time ago.
                        Before you ask, yes, there might've been some (internal) tears shed as I was told to do it as an assignment for class. Not my favorite thing to draw.
                        <br />
                        Art has been a huge part of my life. It has been an outlet to expressing myself when I wasn't able to find words or emote how I truly felt. It has been a source of reflection and meditation. It has brought joy through the people I have met because of it, but it has also brought a lot of frustration when the piece doesn't turn out how I envisioned. I have one of those love-hate relationships with it but I know that in the end, I can't live without it. 
                        <br />
                        My inspirations are all around:
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>People</li>
                            <li>Nature</li>
                            <li>Books</li>
                            <li>Music</li>
                            <li>Video Games</li>
                        </ul>
                        Between my Art and Photography pages, you will see all of these inspirations at work. Well, maybe not any books currently. Anyway, the art is done in many mediums such as conte, colored pencil, watercolor pencil, charcoal. I'm still working on my painting skills and am not quite ready to have those up yet. They will come soon!
